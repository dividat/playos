# PlayOS

A custom Linux system ([NixOS](https://nixos.org/)) for running Dividat Play.

See the [documentation](docs/arch) for more information.

## Quick start

Running `nix build` will create following (in `result/`):

- `bin/`: Tools
- `playos-VERSION-UNSIGNED.raucb`: RAUC bundle that can be used to update systems. Note that it is signed with a dummy development key. Real deployments would resign the bundle with `rauc resign`.
- `playos-installer-VERSION.iso`: Bootable ISO image that can install the system.
- `disk.img`: Preinstalled disk with bootloader, system partitions A/B and data partitions for testing (but without test instrumentation).

### Choose what to build

For quicker development cycles you may pass following arguments to the build:

- `buildInstaller`: Should the installer ISO image be built.
- `buildBundle`: Should the RAUC bundle be built.
- `buildDisk`: Should the preinstalled disk image be built.
- `buildLive`: Should the PlayOS live system image be built.

For example: `nix build --arg buildInstaller false --arg buildBundle false` will only build the system toplevels and the preinstalled disk image.

A virtual machine (with test instrumentation) can be started without any of the above builds.

### Virtual machine

A helper is available to quickly start a virtual machine:

```
make vm && ./result/bin/run-playos-in-vm
```

See the output of `run-playos-in-vm --help` for more information.

## Deployment

Update bundles are hosted on Amazon S3. The script `bin/deploy-playos-update` will handle signing and uploading of bundle.

The arguments `updateUrl` (from where updates will be fetched by PlayOS systems), `deployURL` (where bundles should be deployed to) must be specified. For example: `nix build --arg updateUrl https://dist.dividat.com/releases/playos/master/ --arg deployUrl s3://dist.dividat.ch/releases/playos/master/`.

Commonly used update and deploy URLs (channels) can be used with shortcuts defined in the Makefile.

To release an update to the `develop` channel:

```
make develop
./result/bin/deploy-playos-update --key PATH_TO_KEY.pem
```

### Key switch

When switching key pairs on a channel, the new certficiate must be built into the bundle, which must then be signed with the old key. For this purpose, the `--override-cert` option of the deploy script is needed to provide RAUC with a certificate matching the new key.

## Installation on VirtualBox

1. Use `nix-build`. At least `buildInstaller` must be enabled. See
   https://github.com/dividat/playos/tree/develop#choose-what-to-build.

2. On VirtualBox, create a new virtual machine with:

- RAM: 4096MB,
- Virtual VDI HDD: 60GB dynamically allocated.

Update the following settings:

- `Settings > Display > Graphics controller:` set `VBoxSVGA` (see [this issue](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/trying-to-fix-very-poor-virtualbox-install-experience/2488), but it [should be resolved on NixOS 20.03](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/commit/58d0134da072548eb66d9313ad629e4dffddfd9d)),
- `Settings > System > Motherboard`: enable EFI.

3. Install PlayOS from `result/playos-installer-VERSION.iso` to the virtual
   machine. Donâ€™t forget to remove the optical drive in `Settings > Storage`
   once the installation has been completed.

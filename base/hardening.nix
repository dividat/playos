/* Apply system hardening configuration.

This module acts as a convenient way of disabling a number of standard
NixOS/Linux functionalities that are not required for immutable kiosk
operation. The idea is to disable them for additional system hardening,
removing things that could do harm should the system fall into the hands of an
attacker despite intrusion protection.

It may be convenient to disable the hardening configuration during development
at times.

#+TITLE: PlayOS: User manual

* Overview

PlayOS is a custom operating system for running Dividat Play together with Dividat Senso.

** Supported Hardware

PlayOS runs on most standard ~x86_64~ systems.

The only recommended and supported machine is the /Shuttle DH110/.

* Installation

PlayOS requires the machine to boot in UEFI mode.

Depending on the factory settings of your computer it may be necessary to manually set the boot mode to UEFI. To do this press the ~Delete~ key immediately after powering on the computer. A menu will be shown. Navigate to the tab /Boot/ and set the option /Boot Mode Select/ to /UEFI/:

* Live System

A live system build of PlayOS is available and can be pointed to experimental versions of Play or other web addresses to allow for easy evaluation. This version of PlayOS boots from removable media such as USB keys and has no persistent storage at all. Any configuration done when booted will be reset to defaults on next boot.

Starting up the live system from a USB key works in the same basic manner as during [[*Installation][installation]]. Once started, network and other configuration can be set in the [[*Administration][administration]] interface.

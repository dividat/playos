#+TITLE: PlayOS: User manual

* Overview

PlayOS is a custom operating system for running Dividat Play together with Dividat Senso.

** Supported Hardware

PlayOS runs on most standard ~x86_64~ systems.

The only recommended and supported machine is the /Shuttle DH110/.

* Installation
** UEFI boot mode

PlayOS requires the machine to boot in UEFI mode.

Depending on the factory settings of your computer it may be necessary to manually set the boot mode to UEFI. To do this press the ~Delete~ key immediately after powering on the computer. A menu will be shown. Navigate to the tab /Boot/ and set the option /Boot Mode Select/ to /UEFI/:

Additionally the /Secure Boot Control/ functionality needs to be disabled. Navigate to the tab /Security/ and set the option /Secure Boot Control/ to /Disabled/:

Select the first entry and press ~Enter~. This will boot the PlayOS installer. After the installer is completely booted a prompt will ask for confirmation to install PlayOS on the computer's disk:

[[../screenshots/install-playos.png]]

To continue installation enter ~y~ and press ~Enter~. Note that installation will delete any data already present on the disk.

Installation takes around 5 to 10 minutes. After the installation completes successfully, the computer will automatically restart the computer and boot into the newly install PlayOS system.

* Usage

The system will automatically boot and load Dividat Play.

If the application is not accessible due to a lack of Internet connection, an error message may be shown. In this case you may have to configure Internet access in the [[#network][Network]] settings.

Once the application has been loaded you may log in using the provided credentials and start your training.

Connection to an attached Dividat Senso will automatically be configured. To manually configure connection please refer to the Dividat Play manual.

** Shutting down

The system may be shut down by pressing the power button on the computer or alternatively from the administrator menu.

* Status screen

A status screen providing a brief status report about various components of the system is available on `tty8`. It can be accessed using the key combination ~Ctrl-Alt-F8~. To get back from the status screen to the graphical interface, use ~Ctrl-Alt-F7~.

* Administration

A menu for system administration is provided and may be accessed with the key combination ~Ctrl-Shift-F12~.

Multiple pages are available and may be navigated with the icons on the right of the screen.

** Wiping user data

Certain user data such as Play login credentials, wireless settings are stored persistently on the computer's disk.

User data can be completely deleted (wiped) from the rescue system. To start the rescue system, reboot the computer and press the ~Escape~ key once the message "Welcome to GRUB!" appears. This will show the boot loader menu:

#+CAPTION: Boot loader
#+NAME: fig:boot-loader
#+attr_html: :width 800px
[[../screenshots/boot-loader.png]]

Select the entry "wipe user data / rescue system" with the arrow keys and press ~Enter~.

The rescue system will boot and display a menu:

#+CAPTION: Rescue System
#+NAME:   fig:rescue-system
#+attr_html: :width 800px
[[../screenshots/rescue-system.png]]

Select the entry "wipe-user-data" and press ~Enter~. This will delete all user data and reboot the computer.

The rescue system's boot logs may also be useful when analysing potential hardware issues, as it is configured to reveal more logs from the Linux kernel.

* Live System

A live system build of PlayOS is available and can be pointed to experimental versions of Play or other web addresses to allow for easy evaluation. This version of PlayOS boots from removable media such as USB keys and has no persistent storage at all. Any configuration done when booted will be reset to defaults on next boot.

Starting up the live system from a USB key works in the same basic manner as during [[*Installation][installation]]. Once started, network and other configuration can be set in the [[*Administration][administration]] interface.

** Status screen

A status screen providing a brief status report about various components of the system is available on ~tty8~. It can be accessed using the key combination ~Ctrl-Alt-F8~. To get back from the status screen to the graphical interface, use ~Ctrl-Alt-F7~.

** Clearing kiosk browser cache

At times network issues may cause corrupted media resources to end up in the kiosk browser's cache. In this case it may be helpful to clear this cache to force all resources being downloaded again. A hard refresh can be triggered using ~Ctrl-Shift-R~, which clears the cache and then reloads the kiosk application. The hard refresh does not affect user sessions or preferences, so it can be performed without the user having to log in again.

** Wiping user data

Certain user data such as Play login credentials, wireless settings are stored persistently on the computer's disk.

User data can be completely deleted (wiped) from the rescue system. To start the rescue system, reboot the computer and press the ~Escape~ key once the message "Welcome to GRUB!" appears. This will show the boot loader menu:

#+CAPTION: Boot loader
#+NAME: fig:boot-loader
#+attr_html: :width 800px
[[../screenshots/boot-loader.png]]

Select the entry "wipe user data / rescue system" with the arrow keys and press ~Enter~.

The rescue system will boot and display a menu:

#+CAPTION: Rescue System
#+NAME:   fig:rescue-system
#+attr_html: :width 800px
[[../screenshots/rescue-system.png]]

Select the entry "wipe-user-data" and press ~Enter~. This will delete all user data and reboot the computer.

* Installation

The following instructions are suitable for installing PlayOS to a modern PC and assume that you have access to a USB stick with the desired version of the PlayOS installer.

** (First install) Required boot configuration in BIOS

This section is only relevant when a PC is first installed with PlayOS. If you are updating an existing installation you can skip to the next section.

In order to install and run PlayOS, the PC needs to be set to UEFI mode and allow booting custom operating systems.

To check or set the configuration, press the ~Delete~ key immediately after powering on the computer.

Now make sure that UEFI Secure Boot is disabled:

#+CAPTION: Navigate to the tab /Boot/ and under /Secure Boot/ set /OS Type/ to /Other OS/.
#+NAME: fig:secure-boot
#+attr_html: :width 800px
[[../screenshots/secure-boot.png]]

In systems obtained before 2023 the screen looks differently:

#+CAPTION: Systems before 2023: Navigate to the tab /Security/ and set the option /Secure Boot Control/ to /Disabled/.
#+NAME: fig:secure-boot-dh110
#+attr_html: :width 800px
[[../screenshots/secure-boot-dh110.png]]

In systems obtained before 2023 you may also need to navigate to the tab /Boot/ and set the option /Boot Mode Select/ to /UEFI/:

#+CAPTION: Selecting UEFI boot mode
#+NAME: fig:bios-uefi
#+attr_html: :width 800px
[[../screenshots/bios-uefi.png]]

Once the configuration is complete, navigate to /Exit/ and choose the option to save and exit BIOS.

** Selecting boot medium

<<selecting-boot-medium>>Insert the USB key into the PC. Press and keep pressing the ~F8~ key on the keyboard as you power on the computer to open the boot selection menu. Select the USB key and hit ~Enter~:

#+CAPTION: Boot medium menu after pressing F8
#+NAME: fig:boot-selection
#+attr_html: :width 800px
[[../screenshots/boot-selection.png]]

On systems up until early 2023 the ~F7~ key needs to be pressed while booting instead.

#+CAPTION: Boot medium menu after pressing F7
#+NAME: fig:boot-selection-dh110
#+attr_html: :width 800px
[[../screenshots/boot-selection-dh110.png]]

If you use any other PC, the steps for selecting the boot medium may differ.

** Running the installer

The installer will start and display a boot loader menu:

#+CAPTION: Installer boot loader
#+NAME: fig:installer-boot-loader.png
#+attr_html: :width 800px
[[../screenshots/installer-boot-loader.png]]

Select the first entry and press ~Enter~. This will boot the PlayOS installer. After the installer is completely booted a prompt will ask for confirmation to install PlayOS on the computer's disk:

#+CAPTION: Confirmation to install PlayOS
#+NAME: fig:install-playos.png
#+attr_html: :width 800px
[[../screenshots/install-playos.png]]

To continue installation enter ~y~ and press ~Enter~. Note that installation will delete any data already present on the computer's storage disk.

Installation takes around 5 to 10 minutes. After the installation completes successfully, the computer will automatically restart and boot into the newly installed PlayOS system.

* Live System

A live system build of PlayOS is available and can be pointed to experimental versions of Play or other web addresses to allow for easy evaluation. This version of PlayOS boots from removable media such as USB keys and has no persistent storage at all. Any configuration done when booted will be reset to defaults on next boot.

See the section on [[selecting-boot-medium][selecting a boot medium]] to find out how to start a live system from a USB stick. Once started, network and other configuration can be set in the [[administration][administration]] interface.

# PlayOS Kiosk Browser

Opens a website in a full screen, locked down browser based on [QtWebEngine](http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qtwebengine-index.html).

## Development

To create a suitable development environment run `nix-shell` in this directly. Note however, that this will use your local `nixpkgs` and not the pinned version used by the `playos` repo in whole.

## Usage

See `python ./bin/kiosk-browser --help`
